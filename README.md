Model to predict value of a used car - MAPE and Regression
~OBJ1: Understand the various factors (and their impact on the price) that comes into consideration during the resale of a used car. 
~OBJ2: Devise a model which will capture the formula that can be used to evaluate the tentative price of a used car when itâ€™s up for resale.
Used regression and MAPE as the primary statistical tools for the analysis of this project.
to verify the model for which we randomly split the data (80:20 being the proportion) into two sets namely train and test. All the statistical operations were performed on the train data and it was used to predict it on the test data.
Log-log regression model is used.
MAPE was less 4% hence model is accepted.
